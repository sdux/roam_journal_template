# Roam Research - Morning Reflection Journal Template


#### Inspired by the 5 Min Journal.

When I started using Roam, I was looking for simple templates after popular journaling methods.

Roam recently released an update adding support for building templates and quickly inserting them into your daily notes page.
The templates work super well for building and selecting different journaling techniques you'd like to try.

I've built a simple morning reflection journal modeled after the 5 min journal technique which Tim Ferris uses.

See the video below for an exmaple of functionality.  The static image is how it will appear in Roam.  
A reference section is included with journaling prompts and suggestions on how to be most effective.

Copy the markdown below into a new page in Roam and favorite as your journal template.  You can then reference the template with ';;' inside Roam.

            - **Gratitude Journaling - How To:**
                - List things you're grateful for.  They can be small things (“The tasty snack I had at lunch today.”) or big things (“My partner got promoted!”). The goal is to remember a good event, experience, person, or thing in your life.  This will trigger the good emotions that come with the memory.
                - **Focus on:**
                    - Get specific and dive into detail
                    - Choose Persons or things personal to you
                    - Try inverting - what would your life be without certain things?
                    - Thinking of positives as gifts, this helps to avoid taking things for granted
                    - A few a day is great, don't go too crazy
