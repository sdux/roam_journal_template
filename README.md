            - **Gratitude Journaling - How To:**
                - List things you're grateful for.  They can be small things (“The tasty snack I had at lunch today.”) or big things (“My partner got promoted!”). The goal is to remember a good event, experience, person, or thing in your life.  This will trigger the good emotions that come with the memory.
                - **Focus on:**
                    - Get specific and dive into detail
                    - Choose Persons or things personal to you
                    - Try inverting - what would your life be without certain things?
                    - Thinking of positives as gifts, this helps to avoid taking things for granted
                    - A few a day is great, don't go too crazy
